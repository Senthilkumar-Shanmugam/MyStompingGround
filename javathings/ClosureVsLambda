Close is a special type of lambda. But not all lambdas are closure

Lambda is an anonymous block of function that depends on its arguments
Closure has dp=ependecny on environment variable, it closes over


 (server) -> server.isRunning()   -- This is lambda
 
 () -> server.isRunning --> closure, here server is env. It needs to close that env/capture that variable
 
 
 closure is an instance of function. In lambda there are no instances(it cannot refernce variables outside the lexical scope)
 
 since lambda has no outside dependencies, it is evaluvates only one and can be reused without the fear of side effects. whereas closure needs
 to be evaluvated everytime
